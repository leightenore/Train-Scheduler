## Description 

An app that utilizes Firebase to display a train schedule. Firebase stores each train's name, destination, frequency, and time of the first train.  The app uses Moment.js to calculate the time of each train's next arrival based on the train's first time, the current time, and the train's frequency. It also calculates how far away the train is currently. Users can input their own train data, which will be stored to the database and also be displayed on the schedule.
